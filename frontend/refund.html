        <h2>1. Trial Period</h2>
        <p>New organizations receive a 14-day free trial with no payment required. No credit card is needed to start a trial. If you decide not to continue, simply allow the trial to expire — no charge will be made.</p>

        <h2>2. Subscription Payments</h2>
        <p>Subscription fees are billed in advance (monthly or annually). All payments are processed securely via Stripe.</p>

        <h2>3. Refund Eligibility</h2>
        <p>We offer refunds in the following cases:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Technical failure:</strong> If the Service was unavailable for more than 72 consecutive hours due to our infrastructure, you may request a pro-rated credit for the affected period.</li>
          <li><strong>Accidental duplicate charge:</strong> If you were charged twice for the same billing period, the duplicate charge will be refunded in full.</li>
          <li><strong>Annual plans — first 14 days:</strong> If you subscribed to an annual plan and request cancellation within 14 days of the first payment, we will refund the unused portion minus any applicable transaction fees.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Non-Refundable Items</h2>
        <p>The following are not eligible for refunds:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Monthly subscription fees after the billing period has started.</li>
          <li>Add-on purchases (white-label branding, PDF packs, extra retention, etc.).</li>
          <li>Partial months of service.</li>
          <li>Accounts suspended for violations of our Terms of Service.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <p>To request a refund, email <a href="mailto:support@thronoschain.org">support@thronoschain.org</a> with your organization name, the email address used for billing, and a brief description of the issue. We will respond within 5 business days.</p>

        <h2>6. Processing Time</h2>
        <p>Approved refunds are processed within 5–10 business days and will appear on your original payment method. Stripe processing times may vary.</p>

        <h2>7. Cancellation</h2>
        <p>You may cancel your subscription at any time. Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period. You will retain access to the Service until that date.</p>
