        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>Thronos Driver Platform ("we", "us") is committed to protecting the personal information of drivers, fleet operators, and visitors ("you") who use our Service. This Privacy Policy explains what data we collect, how we use it, and your rights.</p>

        <h2>2. Data We Collect</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Account data:</strong> phone number, email address, name, and role.</li>
          <li><strong>Trip and telemetry data:</strong> GPS coordinates, speed, driving events, and route information submitted during active sessions.</li>
          <li><strong>Voice messages:</strong> audio files sent via the dispatch system, stored temporarily for operator review.</li>
          <li><strong>Usage data:</strong> login timestamps, session tokens (hashed), and IP addresses (hashed for rate-limiting only).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. How We Use Your Data</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>To provide and operate the Service.</li>
          <li>To authenticate users via OTP codes.</li>
          <li>To compute driver safety scores and fleet analytics for your operator.</li>
          <li>To send transactional emails (OTP codes) when email delivery is configured.</li>
          <li>To enforce rate limits and prevent abuse.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Sharing</h2>
        <p>We do not sell your personal data. Trip and telemetry data are shared with your fleet operator (the organization you joined). We may share data with service providers who assist in operating the platform under appropriate confidentiality obligations.</p>

        <h2>5. Data Retention</h2>
        <p>We retain account data for as long as your account is active. Trip and telemetry data are retained according to your organization's plan. You may request deletion of your data by contacting us.</p>

        <h2>6. Security</h2>
        <p>We use industry-standard measures including hashed tokens and hashed identifiers to protect your data. OTP codes are never logged in production environments.</p>

        <h2>7. Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have rights to access, correct, or delete your personal data. To exercise these rights, contact <a href="mailto:support@thronoschain.org">support@thronoschain.org</a>.</p>

        <h2>8. Cookies</h2>
        <p>The Service does not use tracking cookies. Session tokens are stored in browser memory only and are not persisted across browser restarts unless explicitly saved by you.</p>

        <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Policy.</p>
